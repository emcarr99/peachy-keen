## Description

Challenge 2 instructed students to create a landing page that users, or potential employers, could visit and learn more about them. I included an 'about me' section that briefly introduces me and includes a slide show of pictures I wanted to feature, a 'projects' section to highligh my previous work, and finally a 'contact' section so that users can easily get in touch if need be.

## Usage

This site can be accesed here: 

To navigate through the site use the four links in the navigation bar under the logo (Please note that the location of the navigation bar may change depending on your screen size!), if on a larger screen then the navigation bar is top right of the screen. When a user hovers over the links they will appear slightly darker.
