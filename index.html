    <h1>Howdy, I'm Emma!</h1>
    <p>Pleasure to meet ya and I'm glad you came to my site to learn a little more about me. I'm currently enrolled in a full-time full-stack coding bootcamp at UT. I chose to embark on this journey for three main reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Get a certificate that will allow me to work a job I love</li>
      <li>Learn patience with myself</li>
      <li>Become apart of a community</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I was born & raised in El Paso, Texas, where I swam competitively for 20 years! I attened University of Texas Permian Basin and got my Bachelors degree in Criminology. Like many of us, I went into college with one plan and left with a different one...then changed again.</p>
    <p>My work history is varied from swimming based jobs to IT support to Collection, plus my fair share of retail and food service. Growing up my parents have always LOVED their careers and so it has been a goal of mine to love what I do. Well, as you may of guessed the previous work attempts have not been ideal for my long-term happiness. However, they have been vaulable in lessons and life experience - I wouldn't change it for the world.</p>
    <p>Outside of work and academics I love to read! I'm a thriller fanatatic, it makes up for my real-life caution. Reading a nerve-wracking book is a feeling I will never get over. Other than reading, I enjoy learning new crafts, listening to Taylor Swift (or music in general *add winky emoji), and going to concerts. I currently live in Austin, Texas with my boyfriend and our cat Laulu.</p>
